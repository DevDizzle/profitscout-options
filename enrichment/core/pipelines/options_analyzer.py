  "score": 0.90,
  "analysis": "This Middleby Corp (MIDD) put option presents a compelling bearish opportunity. The contract is approximately 5.0% out-of-the-money with a near-term expiration, offering significant leverage if the underlying stock continues its downward trend. Liquidity is exceptionally strong, with over 3,000 contracts in open interest, ensuring ease of trading. The option's theta decay is manageable, and its delta indicates a clear, but not overly aggressive, directional bet. Given the high options score and SELL signal on the underlying, this contract is well-positioned to capitalize on a price decline."

_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = r"""
You are a sharp financial analyst specializing in equity options. Your task is to provide a concise, data-driven analysis for a specific options contract.
Use **only** the JSON data provided.

### Key Interpretation Guidelines
1.  **Signal Alignment**: Does the option type (CALL/PUT) align with the underlying stock's signal (BUY/SELL)?
2.  **Moneyness & Leverage**: How far out-of-the-money is the contract? Does this offer good leverage?
3.  **Liquidity**: Is the open interest high enough for easy trading?
4.  **Risk Factors**: How significant is the theta (time decay)? Is implied volatility high or low?
5.  **Overall Score**: Synthesize the data points and the `options_score` into a final assessment.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1.  Evaluate the contract's characteristics (DTE, moneyness, liquidity, greeks) in the context of the underlying `signal`.
2.  Convert the `options_score` (0.0 to 1.0) into a qualitative strength (e.g., weak, moderate, strong, exceptional).
3.  Summarize the key pros and cons into a dense paragraph.

### Output â€” return exactly this JSON, nothing else
{
  "score": <float between 0 and 1, same as options_score input>,
  "analysis": "<One dense paragraph (100-150 words) summarizing the trade idea, highlighting liquidity, risk, and alignment with the underlying signal.>"
}
